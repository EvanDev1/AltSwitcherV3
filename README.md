# AltSwitcherV3
This program allows you to switch between your Roblox windows (different alts) very quickly at the press of a button.
Right now it's limited to a max of 17 accounts (because I ran out of convenient keybinds).
If you have a NASA pc and want to be able to switch between more than 17 accounts (you'll probably get rate limited by Roblox before then), just reach out to me and I can add more keybinds :)
Have fun :D
## WARNING
1. This program ONLY works on Windows computers (duh).
2. This program WILL be recognized as "unsafe" by your computer. This is because it uses windows processes to see what Roblox windows you have open, and to focus them (letting you switch between them really fast).
I did put up the raw Python script for this program so that you can look through the code and deem it as safe for yourself. You can also just download Python and run the Python file itself if you don't feel uncomfortable running the exe :D

## Download
1. Click on the AltSwitcherV3.exe file, then hit ctrl+shift+s to save it, or you can click on the little 3 dots (...) and then click download. /n
2. Use RobloxAccountManager (https://github.com/ic3w0lf22/Roblox-Account-Manager/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file) to launch all of your alts, and then run this file.
